# CABD-dataset
## A dataset that investigates the displacement of chest and abdominal breathing in relation to changes in back pressure. The displacement data was obtained using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) equipment, while the pressure data was collected using a pressure-sensitive mattress.  
  The motion capture system provides precise tracking of the chest and abdominal movements of experimental subjects during breathing while in a supine position. Simultaneously, pressure maps from the back during the breathing process are collected to explore the relationship between dynamic body pressure and chest and abdominal breathing movements. This data offers, for the first time, a detailed displacement distribution of surface respiratory movements in the chest and abdomen (including head-to-foot direction, arm direction, and tangential direction on the chest and abdomen), as well as changes in back pressure under corresponding conditions.

This repository provides working examples to illustrate the usage of the CABD dataset in:
1.	Offering new perspectives for the study of respiratory mechanics.
2.	Estimating chest and abdominal breathing movements based on dynamic body pressure, quantifying the relationship between dynamic body pressure and these movements.
3.	Exploring potential applications in visceral motion modeling for targeted cancer therapies based on chest and abdominal surface movements.
